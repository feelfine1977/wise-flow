/**
 * SHA-256 of the recorded Canvas calls. Recorded from the implementation that
 * assembled its own scales, overlays and geometry in `prepareScene`, and
 * recorded again when the Canvas drawing began to draw the scene's overlay marks.
 * Compared as filled, stroked and written operations with their colour, alpha,
 * width, dash and transform, that step changed only: overlay arrowheads (12 px,
 * the tip 1.2 px beyond the path's end), the group tint filled once, hatching
 * drawn per hatch overlay after the nodes, and in `toPNG` the figure size, map
 * offset and activity key position, because map-level chips no longer count
 * towards the bounds. Recorded once more when chips began to show what the live
 * map shows; only the chips' calls changed: the glyph written apart, the gauge
 * (track, fill and tick) and the label in bold before the text.
 * Recorded once more when the Canvas drawing began to draw the scene's node
 * and edge marks; compared the same way, only the text of activity labels
 * changed: they are cut to the node's width less its padding and no longer
 * leave room for the case count, which sits below them.
 * Recorded once more when the Canvas legend began to draw the scene's legend;
 * compared the same way, only the glyph of reverse-order arcs changed, to "⌒┄"
 * as on the map (it was "⌒ ┄").
 * Recorded once more when the drawing began to read the token table; compared
 * the same way, only the edge arrowheads changed: the live map's arrow, 3 long
 * and 4.8 wide with the tip on the route's end, filled and outlined by 0.6 in
 * the edge's colour, where it was a triangle of 8 plus the edge width (at most
 * 16). Overlay arrowheads and the line pattern tiles drew the same calls.
 * Recorded once more when arcs began to be drawn between the edges and the
 * nodes: every recording holds the same calls as before, and only the calls of
 * the arcs (stroke, arrowhead and label) moved from after the nodes to after
 * the edges. Recorded once more when arcs began to keep clear of the other
 * activities: the scenes differ only in arc marks (in the global fixture four
 * arcs take another course and four more move their label along the arc; in
 * the vendor fixture two and one; in the unfiltered one, one label), so only
 * the arcs' calls changed. Recorded once more when the start event took the
 * interactive map's outline: only its stroke's width changed, 2 where it was
 * 1.5.
